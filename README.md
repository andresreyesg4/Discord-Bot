# Discord-Bot
-Andres Reyes

Description: This Discord-bot will be scraping popular trends from the most popular social media. The information will be scraped as requested by the users with a list of commands.In a general overview, the Discord API is being used to have an event listiner for specific commands. Depending on the command sent to the channel the bot is in, is the API call that will take place. A great example would be if a user sends "!yt" to the channel, that will make a call to the youtube API to get the most popular videos in the U.S. <br>
There will be a total of four API's used in this project. The experience gained here is making API's work together in one project. The use of Maven for each dependency used for the API's in this project.
